# GDPS List Template
A template for a list for your GDPS

## Usage

### List
> 1. Download the file called `template.zip` from the latest release onto your computer.
> 2. Go onto whatever you use for editing FTP (for the GDPS).
> 3. Open your GDPS on your FTP editor, and go into the Public/HTML directory.
> 4. Create a new folder (I recommend you name it the list name), and extract the contents from the `template.zip` into the folder.
> 5. Update the site and go to https://yourgdpsname.ps.fhgdps.com/YourList (if you're using a custom domain, then just go to your GDPS site and then add /YourList to the end of the URL).
> 6. You can edit the list by going into the `list_name` folder and editing the `data.json` file. Sort levels by their organization in the file.
> 7. The list template also contains a roulette and a level teleporter.

### Leaderboard
> 1. After making the list, go into the `list_name` folder then into the `leaderboard` folder.
> 2. You can edit the `data.json` now. Rank players by their organization in the file.
> 3. The leaderboard template also contains a player teleporter.
